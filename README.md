# Credit-Scoring-Analytics

## üìù Overview
Banks and financial institutions have different business strategies. Normally, public banks tend to minimise business risk, considering only hish cred score loan applicants for leading. Private banks tend to maximise profit, which need to identify optimal credit score toelances. This optimisation is focused on this analytics. New entrants tend to consider every applicant no matter they have low credit score or no credit at all.
##  üë®‚Äçüíª Analysis 
### 1. Problem Statement
The objective is to construct an in-house risk model for subprime mortgages (a type of loan granted to low credit scores applicant ), optimizing profit for a bank. The profit structure involves a gain of $100 from a good customer and a loss of $500 from a bad customer. The dataset overview can be found here: [Credit Scoring Dataset](https://github.com/Rui-Huang-dotcom/Credit-Scoring-Analytics/blob/main/1.%20Credit%20Scoring.csv):

The dataset comprises 3000 records across 30 columns, with the 'Target' variable representing good loans (0) and bad loans (1).
### 2. ETL
Alteryx handles the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, depicted below:

The resultant dataset serves as the foundation for subsequent analyses.
### 3. Data Visualisation
Power BI is employed, illustrating 2500 good loans and 500 bad loans.

### 4. Data Modelling
Utilizing Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest for modeling:

Logistic regression is selected for final modelling methods to predict the likelihood of loan repayment as it has the higest classification accuracy (82.4%)
