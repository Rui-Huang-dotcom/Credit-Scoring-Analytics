##  üë®‚Äçüíª Analysis 
### 1. Problem Statement
The objective is to construct an in-house risk model for subprime mortgages, optimizing profit for a bank. The profit structure involves a gain of $100 from a good customer and a loss of $500 from a bad customer. The dataset overview can be found here: [Credit Scoring Dataset](https://github.com/Rui-Huang-dotcom/Credit-Scoring-Analytics/blob/main/1.%20Credit%20Scoring.csv):
